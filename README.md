# GreenSpace

Visit GreenSpace [https://greenspace.onrender.com/]

To run GreenSpace on your local machine, clone the repo, and in your code editor terminal, run npm i in both the route folder and the frontend folder.

You will need to create a .env in the root folder, GreenSpace, and add the following environmental variables:
NODE_ENV=development
PORT = 8000
MONGO_URI=YOUR MONGODB CONNECTION STRING
JWT_SECRET=JWT_SECRET_STRING

To start the dev server, run 'npm run dev' in the root folder called 'greenpics'. This will run both the server and open up the application in localhost:3000 in your browser.

All changes made after deadline are purely for deployment purposes as we really wanted to show project to our families. Please only judge the project run locally.
